Hello
Vodka08/26/2020
Hey
Salad08/26/2020
Hey man
welcome
Vodka08/26/2020
thank you
Grim Cynicism08/26/2020
Does everyone know how to get to the teams section of github?
Salad08/26/2020
filling out group creation form
vodka if you could post your fullname and student number
Vodka08/26/2020
sure

everything look good there for you guys?
Grim Cynicism08/26/2020
yes
Vodka08/26/2020
yep
Rift08/26/2020
yea
Salad08/26/2020
github has been made
our team name is AiPacman20202
had to be different from first
Grim Cynicism08/26/2020
you followed the instructions exactly
Salad08/26/2020
https://classroom.github.com/g/J-Wqn-GT
can you guys not find it?
Grim Cynicism08/26/2020
I am in and have cloned it already it was second group in list
Salad08/26/2020
good to hear
Vodka08/26/2020
got it, iam in
Grim Cynicism08/27/2020
Master now has an updated TEAM.md when you get a chance check that I got it correct
Salad08/27/2020
Looks good to me
Vodka08/31/2020
Hey guys, I was wondering if we could have a group discussion soon, maybe over discord or something. Just so that we could discuss about the project and get started with it
Salad08/31/2020
Sounds like a good idea. I've got an assignment due this week. But I am happy to find a time to discuss
Vodka09/01/2020
ahh ohk no worries, we can come up with a time that is flexible with all of us
Grim Cynicism09/01/2020
I have already attempted to start but have a toothache that has been preventing sleep. I will attend any meeting you schedule though
Salad09/01/2020
Worry about your health Grim, we have plenty of time to get a head of this project
Grim Cynicism09/01/2020
I am scheduled for oral surgery on monday and can at least talk through my ideas even if the medication is making it hard to code
We also need to decide what types of AI we are adding
1. Heuristic Search Algorithms (using general or Pacman specific heuristic functions).
2. Classical Planning (PDDL and calling a classical planner).
3. Value Iteration (Model-Based MDP).
4. Monte Carlo Tree Search or UCT (Model-Free MDP).
5. Reinforcement Learning â€“ classical, approximate or deep Q-learning (Model-Free MDP).
6. Goal Recognition techniques (to infer intentions of opponents).
7. Game Theoretic Methods.
In your solution, you have to use at least 3 techniques at least for groups of 4 that have been discussed in the subject or explored by you independently, and you can combine them in any form.
I personally don't think 4 is particularly applicable but I could be wrong I also doubt any of us has the Mathematical background to do 7 to a level that would be useful
Salad09/01/2020
I nearly failed ct
so
Grim Cynicism09/01/2020
Of course if any of you think you can find a Nash Equilibrium of the Pacman Capture the Flag contest Speak up please
Grim Cynicism09/08/2020
I have created a pull request of my initial creation of a graph of the board
Vodka09/14/2020
hey guys, just letting you know, i will be spending the next 2 weeks working only on our ai contest project as i have got ct out of the way so  lmk if ya guys also starting we could have a quick discussion and get on to it
Salad09/15/2020
yes, definately need to have a discussion, I have done all assignments so im good to focus on AI for the next 2 weeks
Grim Cynicism09/15/2020
Have any of you thought about what types of AI techniques you would like to add
Salad09/15/2020
either mdp or heuristic
I understand those ones better than most
Grim Cynicism09/15/2020
Which MDP
Salad09/15/2020
value iteration
Grim Cynicism09/15/2020
BTW I am asking so I can determine where my focus should be
Salad09/22/2020
Hey guys, just made a post on github discussions to quickly give a short explanation about what you have done and why. Sorry i've been busy the last 2 weeks. At this point, vodka and I will work on the other agent to get it working before sunday. Cailen, just wanted to know if you're working on the attacking or defending agent
Good luck on todays test
Grim Cynicism09/22/2020
The point of a hive ind agent is that there is no attacking or defending agent
They share a mind and work as a team to achieve the goal of winning the contest
Salad09/22/2020
so whichever ai technique gets the best result is the one that's used?
Grim Cynicism09/22/2020
We will be building multiple techniques into one agent
we can discuss this after the lecture We need a major discussion anyway
I think I will set up a google meeting unless there is an objection
Salad09/22/2020
sounds good
Grim Cynicism09/22/2020
I am declaring the lecture over and will start a google meeting in 15 unless someone objects here
Salad09/22/2020
is everyone available for the meeting?
Grim Cynicism09/22/2020
The meeting will happen even if people are not available because as it stands this group is non functional And alot of comuncation is required if it has any hope of passing that is not Rift doing the entire project on his Own which I for one Find UNacceptable
Salad09/22/2020
I completely agree, and hopefully, with the test being over, we can pull together and get back on track
do you have a link for the meeting?
Grim Cynicism09/22/2020
I will post it in 5 minutes

Join up
Vodka09/22/2020
coming on

Post Discussion Recap
-Discussed what stage we are currently at
-Discussed techniques we plan on exploring
-Discussed Plans for pair programming
-Discussed which techniques will be better for certain situations
-Discussed whether to go optimal route or nemesis route
-Discussed availability to work on assignment
-Discussed Game Theory
-Decided on which techniques to explore first (Heuristic Search, Classical Planning, Value Iteration)
Grim Cynicism09/23/2020
I am going to fix my mothers internet will probably be back by 5 if some one wants to pair program then
Salad09/23/2020
working on it atm, ill let you know if im struggling
Grim Cynicism09/23/2020
I am back and hate ISPs
I am attempting to add the opponent belief state management to the hivemind
Vodka09/23/2020
hey, i would be avail anytime Friday onwards, unfortunately i cant skip work tomorrow, i got a few meetings to handle during the day, but yeah i will be available after 5pm. btw I have started coding and haven't come across any issues yet.
Grim Cynicism09/24/2020
I have implemented belief state tracking for agent positions
It currently has no support for when an agent is eaten but should otherwise be completely accurate
Grim Cynicism09/24/2020
I have an attempt to support enemy agents being eaten now
Grim Cynicism09/24/2020
I just noticed and fixed an error in my edge case adjustment
Does anyone want assistance with their code or reviewing mine
Salad09/24/2020
Working through mine atm, no roadblocks yet
but tomorrow wouldnt mind some help adapting it to use your graph board
we should do another meeting tomorrow
Grim Cynicism09/25/2020
Does anyone have objections to having a meeting tonight
Salad09/25/2020
no objections
Salad09/25/2020
vodka, what time you good for meeting?
Vodka09/25/2020
yeah, I'll be there
@Grim Cynicism, I am working on a* but i was not sure how to go about it working with the hive mind and all, so i started from scratch and have been working on it, pulled some code from my project1 as well. I was wonder if i can get this working would you help me with modifying it so it works with graph board and hive mind
Grim Cynicism09/25/2020
@Vodka Yes. if you want to after the meeting I will try and help you adapt it for the Hivemind but ultimately you will want to incorporate the value iteration by Salad into you heuristic evaluation function
Salad09/25/2020
having dinner atm, would you like me to push?
Grim Cynicism09/25/2020
Yes please
Vodka09/25/2020
yeh, i am lost with that bit, i am not sure how to do the integration
i just restarted the my entire bit today,  whatever i had in the last 2 days was'nt really right
Salad09/25/2020
it has been pushed
Grim Cynicism09/25/2020
Latest version of hivemind pushed
